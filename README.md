# Commands Only Plus


## Type -tg or -togglechat to toggle

Ever Booted up minecraft and seen people saying mean things in the chat and you dont want to see them but you still want to type commands?!?!? Minecraft made an option for this but like most things they fucked it up because spammers still come through so i have set out to fix this problem wit shit code!
